# Image Classification with Gradio

This repository contains a project for classifying images of animals using a deep-learning model and a Gradio interface.


## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Tolgaugur/ImageClassifier.git
    cd ImageClassifier
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

----
This will start a Gradio interface where you can upload images and get predictions after the training.

 ```sh
python gradio_infer.py
 ```

## Note

Make sure to adjust the paths and parameters in the scripts as needed for your specific use case.
